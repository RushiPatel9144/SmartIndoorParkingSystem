## About the Project

The **Smart Indoor Parking System** Android application is designed to assist drivers in finding available parking spots in indoor parking facilities using smart technologies like sensors and real-time data. It aims to reduce the time spent looking for parking spots, optimize the use of parking spaces, and provide a user-friendly interface for drivers.

By leveraging IoT sensors and an Android app, the system provides real-time parking availability, efficient guidance, and navigation to available parking spaces.

### Goals:
- Minimize time spent searching for parking spaces.
- Maximize efficient usage of parking facilities.
- Provide real-time parking availability to users.

## Key Features

- üö¶ **Real-Time Parking Availability**: Displays available and occupied parking spaces in real-time.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Navigation Assistance**: Guides users to the nearest available parking spot.
- üìä **Data Analytics**: Collects parking usage data for facility managers to optimize operations.
- üì± **Android App Integration**: Users can check parking availability and navigate through the parking facility via the Android app.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)
- **Backend**: Firebase (for real-time database)
- **IoT Devices**: Raspberry Pi with Ultrasonic Sensors for real-time parking spot detection with four different dedicated sensors.
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase Realtime Database (for storing parking spot information)

## System Architecture

The system is divided into several components:

1. **IoT Sensors**: Each parking spot is equipped with sensors (e.g., ultrasonic,gas,etc) to detect if the spot is occupied.
2. **Data Processing**: A central server (Raspberry Pi) collects data from the sensors and sends it to the Firebase database.
3. **Android App**: The Android app communicates with Firebase to fetch real-time parking availability and guides users to available spots.
