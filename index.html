    Location services are used only to recommend parking lots near you. We do not store or share this data unless required for a booking.</p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
    We use encryption and secure storage to protect your information. While no system is 100% secure, we are committed to safeguarding your data to the best of our ability.</p>

    <p><strong>User Rights</strong><br>
    You can view and update your account details or request data deletion in the "Manage Account" section. The "Settings" section lets you manage privacy preferences like notifications and location access.</p>
